# Tic-Tac-Toe-vs-Bot
Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares. In this README.md file I will tell you how the code works.

<h2>Single Player</h2>

In single player there's a grid that contains 9 items, each items contains 3 attribute ```onclick(onclick goes user(1) until user(9))```, ```id ```, ``` class``` and a 1 element h1.

```
<div class="grid-item" id="grid-item-1" onclick="user(1)">
    <h1 id="1"></h1>
</div>
```
